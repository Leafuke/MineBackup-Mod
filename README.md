### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is a Companion Mod!**

Please note: This mod is a **companion component** for the **MineBackup desktop application** and **cannot function independently**. You must first download and run the main application for this mod to work properly.

Additionally, for proper inter-process communication, the KnotLink server must be installed on your computer. https://github.com/hxh230802/KnotLink/releases

## What is This?

This lightweight Forge mod serves as a bridge between the powerful **MineBackup desktop application** and **Minecraft itself**. It allows you to enjoy all the conveniences of MineBackup without ever leaving your game.

### ‚ú® This Mod Provides:

* **Rich In-Game Commands**: Use the `/minebackup` command series to manage your world saves directly from the chat. You can also use the hotkey `Alt + Ctrl + S` to back up your world!
* **Real-Time Backup Notifications**: Receive real-time messages from the main application in your game chat‚Äîwhether a backup starts, succeeds, or fails.
* **Seamless Live Backup Support**: When the main application needs to perform a "live backup" (i.e., while the game is running), this mod automatically triggers a safe, complete world save (equivalent to `/save-all`) in the background, ensuring your backup always captures the latest progress.

## üöÄ Installation Guide

1.  **Download the Main Application**: Ensure you have downloaded the `MineBackup.exe` desktop application from the link above and that it runs correctly on your system.
2.  **Download This Mod**: Get the version-matched `minebackup-x.x.x.jar` file from the **[Releases](https://github.com/Leafuke/MineBackup/releases)** page or other mod distribution platforms.
3.  **Install the Mod**: Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your Minecraft client's `mods` folder.
4.  **Run Simultaneously**: Launch your Minecraft game or server. For the mod to function, you **must have the `MineBackup.exe` desktop application running in the background while playing**.

### **üí° Usage Example**

Let's say you want to create a backup for your server's main world:

1.  **Step 1: Find the Configuration and World**
    * Type `/minebackup list_configs` to see your configuration profiles.
        > Chat returns: `Available Configurations: - ID: 1, Name: Survival Server`
    * Type `/minebackup list_worlds 1` to see the worlds under the "Survival Server" profile.
        > Chat returns: `Worlds for Config 1: - Index: 0, Name: world`

2.  **Step 2: Perform the Backup**
    * Now you know the config ID is `1` and the world index is `0`.
    * Type `/minebackup backup 1 0 Preparing for Ender Dragon!`
        > Chat returns: `[MineBackup] Backup task for world 'world' started...`
        > (After a moment)
        > `[MineBackup] Backup successful! World 'world' saved as [Full][2025-08-11_12-33-00]world [Preparing for Ender Dragon!].7z`

3.  **(If Needed) Step 3: Perform a Restore**
    * First, use `/minebackup list_backups 1 0` to list all backup files.
    * Find the filename you want to restore, e.g., `[Full][2025-08-11_12-33-00]world [Preparing for Ender Dragon!].7z`.
    * Execute `/minebackup restore 1 0 "[Full][2025-08-11_12-33-00]world [Preparing for Ender Dragon!].7z"`. (**Tip**: If the filename contains spaces, enclose it in double quotes `""`).

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

* **Q: When I use a command, the chat says "Command failed", "No response", or a similar error.**
    * **A:** Please check and ensure the `MineBackup.exe` desktop application is running in the background on your computer. All features of this mod rely on network communication with the main application.

* **Q: Can this mod be used by itself?**
    * **A:** No. It is a "bridge" and cannot do anything without the main application.
